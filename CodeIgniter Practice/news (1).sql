The 14th Amendment guarantees equal treatment before the law.\nSteven AveryImage copyrightNETFLIX\nImage caption\nThe case of Steven Avery (pictured) and Brendan Dassey received wide attention after the release of the documentary in 2015\nThe verdict comes after Dassey''s appeal was rejected by state courts.\nSteven Drizin, Professor of law at Northwestern University, became involved in the push to have the conviction overturned.\n"I thought that this was a confession that was the result of police coercion," he told the BBC''s Today programme.\n"These detectives had taken advantage of a young man who had severe learning difficulties. The only facts in the confession had been fed to him by the investigators."\nThe case received wide attention in the US and across the world after the release of the 10-part documentary Making a Murderer in December 2015.\nThe filmmakers cast doubt on the legal process to convict Dassey and Avery.\nThe documentary tells the real-life story of Avery, who was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years for sexual assault.\nAfter his release, he was accused and found guilty of murdering Teresa Halbach, a photographer for Auto Trader Magazine.\nMs Halbach''s charred remains were found at Avery''s car salvage yard a week after she had gone there to photograph a minivan for sale.\nThe series focused on the conduct of law officials in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, who risked a huge financial penalty over the first case.'),

This will help to give some reassurance to communities and businesses right the way across the UK".\r\nBut he added that Labour "urgently" want to hear the chancellor "speak up on the importance of keeping Britain''s membership of the European Investment Bank".\r\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Image copyrightTOBIAS SCHWARZ\r\nImage caption\r\nDuring a visit to Berlin in July, Theresa May [pictured with German Chancellor Angela Merkel] indicated the UK would not trigger Article 50 during 2016\r\nThe Treasury said it would assess whether to guarantee funding for certain other projects "that might be signed after the Autumn Statement, but while we remain a member of the EU".\r\nOrganisations such as universities bidding for EU funding before the UK leaves would have that money underwritten by the government.\r\nField\r\nImage caption\r\nThe National Farmers'' Union (NFU) hailed the announcement as "positive"\r\nAt present, farmers receive subsidies and other payments under the EU''s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).\r\nThey get about £3bn a year in subsidies, with the biggest farmers pocketing cheques of £1m. The grants are given for owning land and also taking care of wildlife.\r\nThe National Farmers'' Union (NFU) said the Treasury''s announcement was "positive" for farming.\r\nIts president Meurig Raymond said: "I hope that this short-term certainty will help to deliver longer-term confidence and this is exactly what farm businesses need now."\r\nThe Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents more than 32,000 farmers, landowners and other rural businesses, said the move was "vitally important" but called for a "world-leading" domestic funding policy to be drawn up and ready for 2021.\r\nThe structural and investment funds that will be guaranteed include CAP pillar two, the European Social Fund, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, including European Territorial Cooperation.\r\nPhilip Hammond\r\nImage caption\r\nThe chancellor of the Exchequer will deliver his Autumn Statement to MPs later this year\r\nExamples of projects that have received or are due to receive regional development fund money include:\r\n£5m for the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre at the University of Manchester\r\n£9m for the manufacturing growth programme to support areas in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and the East of England\r\n£3m for a new life sciences incubation and innovation centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire\r\n''Welcome news''\r\nPresident of the Royal Society - a fellowship of many of the world''s most eminent scientists - and Nobel laureate, Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, also welcomed the funding announcement.\r\nHe told BBC Radio 4''s Today programme it was something "we have been arguing consistently for" since the referendum result.\r\nBut Sir Venkatraman added: "Our hope is that any grants that are awarded while we are still in the EU should be allowed to complete."\r\n''No long-term certainty''\r\nScotland''s Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the announcement "falls far short" of what is needed, saying: "A limited guarantee for some schemes for a few short years leaves Scotland hundreds of millions of pounds short of what we would receive as members of the EU."\r\nWelsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "This guarantee only covers about half of the regional funding due to Wales and does not provide the long-term certainty needed and which was promised ahead of the referendum."\r\nAnd Northern Ireland Finance Minister Mairtin O Muilleoir said that while some applicants for EU funds will be helped, it left a "question mark over scores of other vital projects".\r\nLord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the funding commitment "falls well short" and stressed that "local areas need certainty around the future of all of the £5.3bn in EU regeneration funding promised to them by 2020".\r\n"The continued uncertainty risks damaging local regeneration plans and stalling flagship infrastructure projects, employment and skills schemes and local growth," he said.\r\nReuters news agency spoke to a resident of Manbij who described a spot where people were beheaded.
