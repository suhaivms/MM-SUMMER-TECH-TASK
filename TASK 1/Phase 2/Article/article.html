						<h2>PM Modi Goes To Iran Today, Chabahar Port High On Agenda: 10 Points</h2>
						<img src="../img/National/1.jpg" alt="PM Modi Goes To Iran Today, Chabahar Port High On Agenda: 10 Points"/><br/><br/>
						<article>Here are the top 10 developments in this big story:
							PM Modi will land in Teheran airport this evening. Later, he will meet a delegation of Sikhs residing in Iran and visit a local Gurdwara.
							During the visit he will engage with the Iranian top leadership including President Hassan Rouhani to boost trade, energy and strategic ties. He will also meet Iran's supreme religious and political leader Ayatollah Khamenei.  
							The centerpiece of the Prime Minister's visit will be the signing of a trilateral agreement on Chabahar -- a strategic port in the Gulf of Oman on Iran's southern coast with Afghanistan. India will help develop the port.
							In the first phase India plans to invest around $200 million to develop terminals and cargo berths at Chabahar. In the next phase, India plans to build a 500-km railway line between Chabahar and Zahedan.
							Ahead of PM Modi's visit, India has cleared part of its $6.4 billion oil dues to Iran. Discussions will be held on the modalities of payment for the rest.
							The bilateral talks will also feature Indian firms securing rights to develop the offshore Farzad-B gas field, which was discovered by ONGC Videsh.
							During PM Modi's visit, Afghanistan and Iran will sign an agreement to set up a trade and transport corridor with Chabahar as the hub. With this, landlocked Afghanistan will get access to the Iranian port as an alternate to the Pakistani port of Karachi.
							Chabahar will provide India another route to into Afghanistan - with which it has developed close diplomatic and strategic ties -- and through it, to central Asian countries.
							Currently, India does not have access to Afghanistan on a land route due to opposition from Pakistan, which sees India's expansive diplomacy in the region as a threat.
							India's move is also being seen as a balance to China's influence in Pakistan. Chabahar is 100 km from Pakistan's Gwadar port, which China is developing. The Chinese project comes on the heels of its investments in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Maldives.
